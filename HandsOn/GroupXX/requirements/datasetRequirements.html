    <h1>Dataset Requirements for Waste Collection in Madrid</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The dataset selected contains information on waste collection in Madrid, including the type of waste, the district where it is collected, and the amount of waste collected over time.</p>

    <h2>Requirement Evaluation</h2>

    <h3>R1: Data are in one of the selected Smart City domains</h3>
    <p><strong>Satisfied:</strong> The dataset falls within the "Waste Management" domain, which is a key area of Smart City development. The data relates to waste collection by district and type of waste.</p>

    <h3>R2: Data are available as a CSV file</h3>
    <p><strong>Satisfied:</strong> The dataset is available in CSV format.</p>

    <h3>R3: Data have an open license</h3>
    <p>The data can be reused for commercial and non-commercial purposes under an <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.3efdb29b813ad8241e830cc2a8a409a0/?vgnextoid=108804d4aab90410VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=b4c412b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default">open license.</a></p>

    <h3>R4: Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities</h3>
    <p><strong>Satisfied:</strong> The dataset includes geographical entities such as districts of Madrid, which can easily be linked to real-world entities using geographical datasets like DBpedia or GeoNames.</p>

    <h3>R5: Documentation exists for the data (Optional)</h3>
    <p><strong>Not Satisfied:</strong> The dataset does not come with detailed documentation. However, the column names are intuitive, and the structure is easy to interpret.</p>

    <h3>R6: Data can come from multiple data sources (Optional)</h3>
    <p><strong>Not Satisfied:</strong> This dataset is provided by a single source, the waste collection system of Madrid. However, it could be enriched by combining it with other datasets (e.g., demographic or geographic data).</p>

    <h3>Linking to Other Datasets</h3>
    <p>The dataset includes district-level information, specifically the district names and codes, which can be linked to external datasets. For example, the districts of Madrid can be linked to demographic datasets that provide additional data such as population, income levels, or socio-economic indicators for each district. Additionally, the dataset could be linked with geographic datasets, like those found in DBpedia or GeoNames, to provide geographical context and further enhance the data's usefulness.</p>
