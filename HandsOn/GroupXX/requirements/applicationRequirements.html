    <h1>Application Requirements for Waste Collection Visualization</h1>

    <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>

    <h3>1. Waste Collection Map</h3>
    <p>The application must display a map of Madrid showing all the waste collection points. Each point should provide information on the type of waste collected (e.g., "Cardboard", "Glass") and the quantity collected.</p>

    <h3>2. Filter by District and Waste Type</h3>
    <p>The user should be able to filter the waste collection points by district and by type of waste, enabling them to view relevant information according to their needs.</p>

    <h3>3. Data Visualization</h3>
    <p>The application should provide a graphical visualization (e.g., bar charts) of the amount of waste collected by month and type of waste.</p>

    <h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>

    <h3>1. Usability</h3>
    <p>The application should be easy to use and intuitive. The user should be able to quickly access information with minimal clicks.</p>

    <h3>2. Performance</h3>
    <p>The application should load and display data in less than 3 seconds under normal load conditions.</p>

    <h3>3. Accessibility</h3>
    <p>The application should follow standard web accessibility guidelines to ensure it is usable by a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.</p>

    <h2>User Interface Mock-ups</h2>
